        <h3>What I love about Music</h3>
        <p>Music has always been an integral part of my life. <br />
        There is rarely a moment when I'm not listening to music. <br />
        In many of my pivotal moments, I was listening to music or a song from that time brings me back. <br />
        Although the songs I've listed here do not have that affect on me, I know in time they will. <br />
        Some songs that remind me of specific times of my life are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/zRhVqcfoLuI">Times Like These by The Eden Project</a></li> <!--This song reminds me of when I finally came to terms with being in foster care. I was fortunate enough to have a great foster mom.-->
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/jSCgNKaG5WQ">Calling Out by Amidy</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/qqXjt5WFPgc">Honest by The Neighbourhood</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/MHMdv2D7ndc">start//end by EDEN</a></li><!--This song always made me emotional and for a while, it would remind me of my hardest moments. Now I can finally listen to it and reflect on my past rather than dwell on it-->
        </ul>
            <p>
                These songs, among many others, remind me of the hardships I faced and how I overcame them. <br />
                To me, that is the beauty of music. The artist will create with a specific emotion or feeling <br />
                but listeners can still make it their own.
            </p>

        <h1>My All-Time Favorite Artist</h1>
        <h3>EDEN</h3>
        <p>
            Several years ago, I stumbled upon a song called XO by The Eden Project on youtube. I fell in love with it because of its simplicity. <br />
            As time went on, I would find other songs by The Eden Project on Youtube and SoundCloud. Then in 2015, he changed his alias to EDEN <br />
            and began writing and producing music with a slightly different feel to it. I still loved the music he was putting out so I <br />
            continued to follow him and anticipated every release. Since I've been a long-time fan, I feel as if I've grown with him. <br />
            All of his music, brings me back to different times in my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/smkIPhppvjw">Catch Me If You Can</a> from his first EP as EDEN, <br />
            brings me back to my middle school years when I first started to learn about identities and who I might be. <br />
           And <a href="https://youtu.be/d0uBuSYCD4g">projector</a>, that brings me back to my second semester in college when I was still at SUNY New Paltz <br />
            It was rough adjusting to college life, being away from home and trying to find good people to surround myself with. <br />
            I hope as I continue to grow, I will continue to love EDEN's music and let it be an integral part of my life.
